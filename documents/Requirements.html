<p>Overview</p>

<p>The remaining elements of this document highlights the functions and appearance of the Subby website. </p>

<p>Overall Description</p>

<p> Renting with Subby:   Those students seeking to sublet a residence can use the rental database at any time without charge and without a Subby account. A hopeful subtenant can search for housing using customized search filters designed with student renters in mind. Thus, in addition to standard search fields such as price and location (by address or location), search results can be further refined by:   &middot; Property Type &ndash; single bedroom, shared bedroom, etc  &middot; Size &ndash; number of beds/bedrooms/washrooms &middot; Distance from Campus -- distance range from a given university campus &middot; Convenience -- how convenient is it to reach a nearby plaza, gym, etc... &middot; Availability -- move in date &middot; Rental Period -- users can sublet for periods of 4 or 8 months &middot; Keyword Search -- search for features and amenities such as &lsquo;onsite laundry&rsquo; &middot; Number of Roommates -- the number of roommates expected to occupy residence during stay &middot; Leasee Rating -- the star-point rating of the lease owner from a scale of 0 to 5 stars   Once a sublet seeker finds a unit to their liking they must create a profile of their own using a university email to be able to add the property in question to their &lsquo;Wish List.&rsquo; Otherwise, the sublet seeker may directly contact The lessee by sending them a message of interest through the communication form appeared on every listing page.</p>

<p>Subleasing with Subby:   To promote available rental units, users must first register and create an account using a valid university email. Once a Subby account holder, a user can create a listing for their residence(s) under &lsquo;My Listings&rsquo; and promote \ said listing through a title, description, up to 20 captioned photographs and a myriad of search fields, including price, property type, rental period and size.    Moreover, registered users can create personalized profiles so that potential subtenants may get to know the leasee a little bit better. Under &lsquo;My Profile&rsquo;, a user can upload a photo, include their name, contact information, and profile description.        </p>

<p>Here, we will describe how Subby works as a whole to make subletting easier for students. </p>

<p>2.1. Product Perspective</p>

<p>Subby is a website that will utilize Google Maps API to help individuals locate and post sublets in the Waterloo area. </p>

<p> Actors and Use Cases</p>

<p></p>

<p> 2.1.1. Front-End Users</p>

<p>Subby will have a rather simplistic design to make it easier for front-end users to use. The homepage will consist of a search bar in the middle, where students can search for sublets, along with a sign-in link and a register link located at the top of the page. Since the website is targeted for students, individuals will have to register using a school email address. By doing so, the amount of fake accounts will decrease resulting in less spam and it will be easier to set the location of the account to a certain university. </p>

<p>There will be 2 types of front-end users: </p>

<p> 1) Lease Owner &ndash; the individual looking to sublet their place These individuals must register to post After registration, they may post details about the property they are subletting (i.e. pictures, brief description of their place, price, location)  They can edit their post any time (i.e. lower the price, mark as sold, delete the listing) They can share their posts to social sites like twitter, facebook, etc.</p>

<p>2) Sublet Seeker &ndash; the individual looking for a sublet  These individuals do not have to register to use the website They can edit the location and set various filters on their searches (i.e. they want a sublet near Laurier for 4 months under $500 with an ensuite bathroom) Once they see a sublet they&rsquo;re interested in, they can contact the lease owner with a contact form set to the lease owner&rsquo;s email They could also choose to register and post a &ldquo;WANTED&rdquo; advertisement if they do not see anything that meets their requirements Will have a &ldquo;FAVOURITE&rdquo; and &ldquo;SHARE&rdquo; function &ndash; if users find a room they like, they could add them to a list of potential sublets they&rsquo;re interested in or share it with a friend who might be interested in it as well</p>

<p> 2.1.2. Back-End Users</p>

<p>The back-end users will be the administrators of the website looking to maintain the integrity of the site. </p>

<p>Here are the main features available for back-end users:  Enforce Rules: The administrators of Subby will look to ensure individuals are using the website properly.  Regulate Rules: Give appropriate punishments to individuals who violate the rules (i.e. spamming, scammers, etc). Punishments could include giving them warnings and banning their accounts.  Provide Great Customer Service: Individuals will be able to contact a Subby administrator by email if any problems or questions arise. </p>

<p> 2.1.3. Other Features</p>

<p>Review Both sublet seekers and leaser owners can rate each other depending on their experience on a scale of 1 &ndash; 5. For instance, the sublet seeker can rate their experience with the lease owner and the lease owner can rate their experience with the sublet seeker. This will allow individuals to trust others more freely if they have good reviews. </p>

<p>Ads Potentially have school-related ads on the website to generate revenue. </p>

<p>Auction/Bidding Feature Allow the lease owners to either declare a firm price or allow sublet seekers to bid on their property.</p>

<p>Tinder Swipe Users could swipe &ldquo;left&rdquo; or &ldquo;right&rdquo; on apartments to make the search easier. </p>

<p></p>

<p>2.2. Product Functions</p>

<p>Every individual will have the option to search for sublets. Registered users will be able to post listings. Everyone will have access to the Google Maps displaying the subletting options. If a user has specific requirements that need to be met, then they can use the filters while searching for a sublet. In addition, if a person is looking to sublet their place, they can search for individuals looking for a specific sublet using the filters. Individuals can directly message each other using the emails they registered with. </p>

<p>2.3. User Characteristics</p>

<p>Subby is made for students with basic knowledge of how to navigate a website. The website will be designed to be as straightforward as possible so even the most non-technological individuals can use it.</p>

<p>2.4. Constraints</p>

<p>In terms of the auction/bidding feature, it may be difficult to identify the validity of the bids. Users could be making other accounts and bidding on their own properties to earn more money. In order to mitigate this, we plan to make individuals sign up with their school email since they should only have one school email. </p>

<p>2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies</p>

<p>Although anyone can visit and search the rental database, to contact a leasee or post a unit to sublet, users must first register with a valid university or college email. Individuals are expected to have access to a device with Wi-Fi and use a browser compatible with Google Maps. </p>

<p>3. Specific Requirements</p>

<p>3.1. External Interfaces Unless otherwise stated all inputs listed here will be stored in the application database as appropriate for the model it represents. User Management The user will be allowed to change their password by providing their current password, the new password, and confirmation of the new password to ensure no typos have been made. The user will be able to change their email with a simple form, validated against typical email format. The user will be able to enter their own address for the application to more accurately determine which Sublet records may be relevant to them. User &lsquo;Favorites&rsquo; View All listings with a matching Favorite record will be displayed to the user, as well as links to view the full listing and delete the Favorite record. Favorites which no longer have an existing Sublet record will still be displayed, with a notification that the listing is no longer available. Sublet Listings Will list all sublets that fall within a default radius from the user (determined by IP geolocation or browser functionality) unless otherwise defined by the user. Each listing will display its rating as a one-decimal float (the average of all ratings it has), as well as address, availability date, and distance. The search functionality for this page is primarily based on listing address. However, filters may further exclude the returned records based on user selection. Filters will include sublet attributes such as the number of bedrooms, amenities, review ratings, and so on. Search queries are not stored, and are simply used to filter database results for a given area. Sublet Wanted Listings User emails will not be displayed for those wanting to contact posters of &lsquo;Sublet Wanted&rsquo; postings. The application will provide a simple form which will broker the first email between the two users, preventing malicious users from scraping email addresses from our system. Similar filters and distance options will be available, as with the Sublet Listings page. The same limits for maximum number of listings per area will be imposed for Sublets Wanted. Listing Management A list of an individual User&rsquo;s Sublet or Sublet Wanted listings will appear on this page, with the address and various actions such as &lsquo;edit&rsquo; or &lsquo;delete&rsquo;. A listing may be edited or created, and may have photos, descriptions, or attributes added to it. A maximum of 8 photos will be allowed, and descriptions limited to short text (<500 characters) Review Submission An integer rating range of 1 to 5 is allowed to be submitted along with a short text description. The description will be sanitized for safety of the database and application. User Administration A list of all users, their email addresses, and number of postings will be shown to the administrator as well as links to &lsquo;edit&rsquo;. User Administration - Edit An administrator will be able to edit a user&rsquo;s email address as well as send a password reset link. The administrator will not be allowed to directly edit a user&rsquo;s password. The administrator will be able to select to &lsquo;ban&rsquo; or &lsquo;delete&rsquo; a user.</p>

<p>3.2. Functions The system shall perform basic validation for all models. For example, a User cannot be created without an email address (which must also pass a simple email format validation), and a Sublet posting cannot be made without an availability date. The system shall ensure that users are not creating more than their administrator-defined allowed postings for their geographic area. The system shall allow administrators to ban users, removing their posts and account access but maintaining the user record to prevent later sign-ups from that address. Deleting a user performs the same task, but also removes the user record. The system shall delete dependent records when a model is removed. For example, deleting a Sublet posting will remove Favorite records associated with it, and deleting a User would remove the Sublet postings created by them. Deleting a Sublet posting will also delete Favorite records associated with it. A notification</p>

<p> 3.3. Logical Database Requirements Several tables with many attributes will be required to maintain the data for this project. All tables will have a unique ID as the primary key for the table. Users table: The Users table will require a distinct and unique email address, and salted/hashed passwords will also be stored. Two user types will be supported- regular clients who sign up from the web application and administrators who will have access backend functionality, which can be defined as a tinyint and treated as a boolean in the business logic of the application. Account status (such as bans or strikes against the account) will also be stored. Note that users can have zero-to-many relationships with the Sublets, Reviews, and Favorites tables. Sublets table: Analogous to postings, the Sublets table will include address information (longitude/latitude as provided by Google&rsquo;s Maps API), availability date, pricing, and so on. An individual sublet posting will be owned by a User through their distinct ID as a foreign key. As the &lsquo;Wanted&rsquo; feature would cover many of the same attributes as a regular sublet, conditional logic or a &lsquo;boolean&rsquo;-treated field would determine whether a Sublet record is for a physically offered sublet, or a sublet-wanted ad. Reviews table: Reviews will have foreign keys for both the owning User as well as the Sublet record it is for and the User owning that sublet, preventing it from being invalidated when a posting is removed. It will also include a text field for the review content as well as an integer column for rating. Favorites table: The Favorites table will include foreign keys on both Users and Sublets, allowing a User to look up several Sublet records that were of interest to them at some point. This is a simple join table, and no other information should be required. Additional tables, such as those related to Auction/Bidding type listings may be added to support the product roadmap as features are implemented. Indexes will applied to all uniquely identifying fields such as ID&rsquo;s (as well as other fields of import, such as email addresses or location data) to ensure fast lookups for individual and related records.</p>
